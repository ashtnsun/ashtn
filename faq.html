          <h3>How do I join?</h3>
          <p>Contact us to join our email list or come to one of our Callouts at the beginning of each Semester. You will then get an email listing out more information about the team. All you will have to do after this is pay dues to officially join!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>How much swimming experience do I need to join the team?</h3>
          <p>We welcome swimmers of all levels of experience. Our coaches will usually have different practice intervals to tailor the workout intensity to your level of fitness. We do not provide swim lessons, so at a minimum, you will need to know how to swim.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>How much are dues and what do they cover?</h3>
          <p>Dues are about $95 per semester. These cover meet, hotel, and travel fees throughout the semester as well as complementary apparel.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>When and where is practice?</h3>
          <p>Practices are held at the Morgan J. Burke Aquatic Center on Monday-Friday. Practices run from 6:30-7:30 PM Monday, Wednesday, and Friday and are from 8:30-9:30 PM on Tuesday and Thursday. All practices are optional.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What are practices like?</h3>
          <p>Coaches will typically write sets in the 2800-3000 yard range per practice with intervals occasionally varying by lanes. Each day will have a different focus (ex: IM, stroke, sprint, distance, etc.) and are all optional to the individual. Our sets focus on quality rather than quantity, though still aim to challenge you. Our student coaches simply want you to have fun and help you achieve your goals!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What gear do I need for practice?</h3>
          <p>All you will need is a swimsuit, cap, and goggles. Kickboards and pull buoys are provided at the pool.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>How many swim meets are there per semester?</h3>
          <p>We typically have about 3-4 swim meets per semester and usually have at least 1 away meet per semester. All of these meets are optional.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>How far away are swim meets?</h3>
          <p>Swim meets can be anywhere from 1-2 hours (e.g., Northwestern) to 4-5 hours away (e.g., MSU or Ohio State). For all meets that are further away, we will stay overnight in a hotel.</p>
